## Before You Begin — Read These First

```
AI_ENGINEER_ROADMAP.md                            ← understand the destination (local copy)
QUICK_START.md                                     ← understand the Python repo structure
DAILY_JOB_GUIDE.md                                ← understand what skills matter at work
../AI-ENGINEERS-ATLAS/00_Learning_Guide/How_to_Use_This_Repo.md
../AI-ENGINEERS-ATLAS/00_Learning_Guide/Learning_Path.md
```

---

## How to Use This Path

- **Reading order per module:** `theory.md` → `practice.py / Code_Example.md` → `cheatsheet.md` → `interview.md`
- **Do not skip practice files** — reading alone gives 30% retention, coding gives 90%
- **Mark progress** using `AI-ENGINEERS-ATLAS/00_Learning_Guide/Progress_Tracker.md`
- Each phase has a **target level** — if you already know it, skim the cheatsheet and move on
