You're building a spam classifier. Your model says an email is 70% likely to be spam. A colleague asks: "How confident are you that this model actually works and isn't just guessing?" You run a test — on 1000 emails it catches 87% of spam. But is that luck, or is it real? These questions are statistics: the science of learning from data when the data is incomplete, noisy, and sampled — which describes every real dataset you will ever work with.

# 1. Descriptive Statistics — Summarizing Data

Before any model, you describe your data. The three things you always want to know:

**Center**: where is the data concentrated?
**Spread**: how variable is it?
**Shape**: is it symmetric, skewed, multi-modal?

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

data = [12, 15, 14, 10, 99, 13, 16, 12, 14, 11]   # note: 99 is an outlier

# Measures of center
mean   = np.mean(data)           # 21.6  ← pulled up by 99
median = np.median(data)         # 13.5  ← robust to 99
mode   = stats.mode(data).mode   # 12    ← most frequent value

# Measures of spread
std    = np.std(data, ddof=1)    # ddof=1 for sample std (Bessel correction)
var    = np.var(data, ddof=1)    # variance = std²
iqr    = stats.iqr(data)         # interquartile range: Q3 - Q1

print(f"Mean: {mean:.1f}, Median: {median:.1f}")
print(f"Std: {std:.1f}, IQR: {iqr:.1f}")

# Full summary with pandas
s = pd.Series(data)
print(s.describe())   # count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75%, max
```

**When to use mean vs median:**
- Use **mean** when data is symmetric, no extreme outliers
- Use **median** when data is skewed or has outliers (house prices, salaries, response times)

# 2. Probability Distributions

A **probability distribution** describes how likely each outcome is.

```
Discrete distributions (countable outcomes):
┌─────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Distribution    │ Use Case                                     │
├─────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Bernoulli       │ Single coin flip: P(heads) = p              │
│ Binomial        │ k successes in n flips: spam in 100 emails  │
│ Poisson         │ Count of events per time: API calls/second  │
└─────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Continuous distributions (any value in a range):
┌─────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Distribution    │ Use Case                                     │
├─────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Normal/Gaussian │ Errors, measurement noise, many ML outputs  │
│ Uniform         │ Random split thresholds, hyperparameter search│
│ Exponential     │ Time between events (arrivals, failures)    │
│ Beta            │ Probability estimates: click-through rates  │
└─────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

```python
from scipy import stats
import numpy as np

# Normal distribution (mean=0, std=1)
dist = stats.norm(loc=0, scale=1)
print(dist.pdf(0))          # 0.399 — peak probability density at mean
print(dist.cdf(1.96))       # 0.975 — 97.5% of values below 1.96
print(dist.ppf(0.975))      # 1.960 — the value at the 97.5th percentile

# Binomial: probability of getting k=7 heads in n=10 flips with p=0.5
binom = stats.binom(n=10, p=0.5)
print(binom.pmf(7))         # 0.117 — P(exactly 7 heads)
print(binom.cdf(7))         # 0.945 — P(at most 7 heads)

# Sample from a distribution
samples = stats.norm.rvs(loc=170, scale=10, size=1000)  # 1000 heights

# 3. The Normal Distribution and Why It's Everywhere

The **normal distribution** (bell curve) appears naturally when many independent random factors add together, or when measurement errors accumulate.

```
μ-3σ  μ-2σ  μ-σ    μ    μ+σ   μ+2σ  μ+3σ
 |     |     |      |     |     |     |
 |  2% | 14% | 34%  | 34% | 14% |  2% |
 └─────┴─────┴──────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘

68% of data falls within 1 std of the mean
95% of data falls within 2 std of the mean
99.7% of data falls within 3 std of the mean
```

**The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**: If you take many samples from any distribution and compute each sample's mean, those sample means will be normally distributed — regardless of the original distribution's shape. This is why we can apply normal-distribution-based tests to non-normal data, as long as the sample size is large enough (typically n > 30).

```python
# Demonstrate CLT: sampling from a skewed distribution
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats

# Original: highly skewed exponential distribution
population = np.random.exponential(scale=2, size=100000)
print(f"Population skewness: {stats.skew(population):.2f}")   # ~2 — very skewed

# Sample means become normal as sample size grows
sample_means = [np.mean(np.random.choice(population, size=50)) for _ in range(1000)]
print(f"Sample means skewness: {stats.skew(sample_means):.2f}")   # ~0 — normal!
```

# 4. Hypothesis Testing

You changed your recommendation algorithm. Click-through rate went from 3.2% to 3.8%. Is that a real improvement, or could it happen by chance with the old algorithm?

Hypothesis testing gives you a framework to answer this.

**The logic:**
1. State the **null hypothesis** H₀: "nothing changed — the difference is random noise"
2. State the **alternative hypothesis** H₁: "something real changed"
3. Compute how likely your observed result would be if H₀ were true (the **p-value**)
4. If p-value < threshold (usually 0.05): reject H₀, accept H₁

```python
from scipy import stats
import numpy as np

# A/B test: did changing the button color improve click-through rate?
# Group A: old button — 320 clicks from 10000 views = 3.2%
# Group B: new button — 380 clicks from 10000 views = 3.8%

clicks_a, n_a = 320, 10000
clicks_b, n_b = 380, 10000

# Two-proportion z-test
count = np.array([clicks_a, clicks_b])
nobs  = np.array([n_a, n_b])

z_stat, p_value = stats.proportions_ztest(count, nobs)

print(f"Z-statistic: {z_stat:.3f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")

if p_value < 0.05:
    print("Statistically significant — reject H₀")
else:
    print("Not significant — cannot reject H₀")
```

**p-value explained plainly**: "If there truly were no difference, the probability of seeing a gap this large or larger by random chance is p."

p-value of 0.03 means: only a 3% chance of seeing this result if nothing actually changed. We conclude something changed.

# 5. Type I and Type II Errors

```
                   Reality
                   H₀ True         H₀ False
Test    Reject H₀  Type I Error ✗   Correct ✓
Result  Keep H₀    Correct ✓        Type II Error ✗

Type I error  (False Positive): flagging a good model as better — wasted rollout
Type II error (False Negative): missing a real improvement — lost revenue
```

- **α (significance level)**: acceptable false positive rate. Standard: 0.05
- **β (false negative rate)**: 1 - statistical power
- **Power (1-β)**: probability of correctly detecting a real effect. Target: 0.80

```python
# Sample size calculation for A/B test
from statsmodels.stats.power import NormalIndPower
import numpy as np

effect_size = 0.2   # Cohen's d — small effect
alpha = 0.05
power = 0.80

analysis = NormalIndPower()
n_required = analysis.solve_power(effect_size=effect_size, alpha=alpha, power=power)
print(f"Required sample size per group: {int(np.ceil(n_required))}")
```

<a id="6-bayes-theorem"></a>
# 6. Bayes' Theorem

**Bayes' theorem** updates your belief in a hypothesis given new evidence.

`P(A|B) = P(B|A) × P(A) / P(B)`

Classic example: medical test for a rare disease.
- Disease prevalence: 1% (prior)
- Test sensitivity: 99% (P(positive | disease))
- Test specificity: 99% (P(negative | no disease))

```python
# Bayes: given a positive test, what's the probability of actually having the disease?
prevalence = 0.01        # P(disease) — prior
sensitivity = 0.99       # P(positive | disease)
specificity = 0.99       # P(negative | no disease)

p_positive_given_disease    = sensitivity                      # 0.99
p_positive_given_no_disease = 1 - specificity                  # 0.01

# Law of total probability: P(positive)
p_positive = (p_positive_given_disease * prevalence +
              p_positive_given_no_disease * (1 - prevalence))

# Bayes' theorem: P(disease | positive)
p_disease_given_positive = (p_positive_given_disease * prevalence) / p_positive

print(f"P(positive test): {p_positive:.3f}")
print(f"P(disease | positive test): {p_disease_given_positive:.3f}")
# Result: only ~50% — surprising! Low prevalence dominates.
```

This result — that a positive test from a rare disease still only gives ~50% probability — illustrates why Naive Bayes classifiers work despite their independence assumption: prior probability matters enormously.

<a id="7-correlation-and-covariance"></a>
# 7. Correlation and Covariance

**Correlation** measures the linear relationship between two variables.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])
z = np.array([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])   # negatively correlated with x

# Pearson correlation (-1 to +1)
print(f"corr(x, y): {np.corrcoef(x, y)[0,1]:.3f}")   # ~0.9 — strong positive
print(f"corr(x, z): {np.corrcoef(x, z)[0,1]:.3f}")   # -1.0 — perfect negative

# DataFrame correlations
df = pd.DataFrame({"x": x, "y": y, "z": z})
print(df.corr())   # correlation matrix

# Spearman (rank-based, robust to non-linear relationships)
from scipy.stats import spearmanr
corr, p_val = spearmanr(x, y)
print(f"Spearman: {corr:.3f}, p-value: {p_val:.3f}")
```

**Correlation ≠ causation.** Two variables can be correlated because:
- A causes B
- B causes A
- A third variable C causes both (confounding)
- Pure coincidence (spurious correlation)

## 🔥 Summary

Statistics is the discipline that separates "my model got 87% accuracy" from "my model reliably gets 87% accuracy." Every real dataset is incomplete, noisy, and sampled — statistics gives you the tools to reason about what you can and cannot conclude.

**Common mistakes to avoid:**

- **Ignoring p-value interpretation**: p < 0.05 means the result is statistically significant, not that the effect is practically important. A tiny effect with a huge sample will be statistically significant but useless.
- **Using mean on skewed data**: always check the distribution shape. For salary analysis, median tells the truth; mean is misleading.
- **Applying parametric tests to non-normal small samples**: t-tests assume normality. For n < 30 with non-normal data, use Mann-Whitney U or bootstrap methods.
- **Ignoring multiple testing**: running 20 t-tests with α=0.05 means you'd expect 1 false positive by chance. Use Bonferroni correction or FDR control.

| Concept | One-line summary |
|---|---|
| Mean / Median / Std | Describe center and spread — choose based on outliers |
| Normal distribution | Bell curve; 68-95-99.7 rule; CLT makes it universal |
| Hypothesis test | p-value: probability of this result assuming nothing changed |
| Type I / II errors | False positive vs false negative — trade-off via α and power |
| Bayes' theorem | Update belief with evidence; prior probability matters |
| Correlation | Linear relationship strength — not causation |
